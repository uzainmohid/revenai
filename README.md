# RevenAI — Stop Revenue Leakage Before It Impacts Growth

RevenAI is an AI-powered revenue protection platform built for fintech and B2B subscription companies.

We help organizations proactively detect hidden revenue risks, eliminate silent losses, and protect recurring income — before they impact growth, valuation, or trust.

This is not a dashboard experiment.  
This is a production-grade AI product engineered for real business impact.

Recurring revenue businesses operate at scale. Small inefficiencies compound into significant losses.

RevenAI applies intelligent risk detection models to subscription and transaction data to surface:

- Behavioral anomalies impacting income  

Our focus is measurable financial protection — not vanity analytics.
